打开其中一个错误文件(/usr/include/gazebo-11/gazebo/msgs/quaternion.pb.h)前20行: //

```

// Generated by the protocol buffer compiler.  DO NOT EDIT!
// source: vector3d.proto

#ifndef PROTOBUF_INCLUDED_vector3d_2eproto
#define PROTOBUF_INCLUDED_vector3d_2eproto

#include <string>

#include <google/protobuf/stubs/common.h>

#if GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_VERSION < 3006001
#error This file was generated by a newer version of protoc which is

#endif
#if 3006001 < GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_MIN_PROTOC_VERSION
#error This file was generated by an older version of protoc which is
#error incompatible with your Protocol Buffer headers.  Please
#error regenerate this file with a newer version of protoc.
#endif

```

根据报错信息：This file was generated by a newer version of protoc which is incompatible with your Protocol Buffer headers.  Please update your headers. (注意断句。。。)得知原因为第一个if语句，GOOGLE_PROTOBUF版本低于3.6.1，解决办法为升高版本。

查看现有版本（系统当前识别的版本）位置：

```
zonlin@zonlin3590:~/catkin_ws$ which protoc
/usr/local/bin/protoc
zonlin@zonlin3590:~/catkin_ws$ protoc --version
libprotoc 3.4.0


```

将现有protoc版本删除：

```

root@zonlin3590:/home/zonlin/catkin_ws# rm /usr/local/bin/protoc
root@zonlin3590:/home/zonlin/catkin_ws# which protoc
/usr/bin/protoc
root@zonlin3590:/home/zonlin/catkin_ws# protoc --version
libprotoc 3.6.1

```

protobuf版本自动回到3.6.1（应该是ros自带版本)。若无protobuf，则手动安装编译protobuf3.6.1。

***2.编译"catkin_Make"时报错：
